# Abstract:
This article introduces an improvised smart home system, describing the system architecture, hardware components, and software solutions. The primary system is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer and a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which has web and Android applications and can be accessed via Wi-fi and the Internet. A wide range of sensors is attached to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which transmits data to the main Raspberry Pi 4 through MQTT. The system includes various smart home features and facilitates System Control functionalities, enabling users to control their home environment and efficiently operate the Raspberry Pi 4. The software is uniquely designed in a way that users can be well-informed about System health and load. Moreover, users can also manage each smart home feature separately so that no program can run in the system background independently. All these functionalities will ensure the system users' safety and security, save energy, and assist in avoiding accidents without requiring technical knowledge.
